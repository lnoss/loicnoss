# loicnoss.com - portfolio

Static portfolio developed with **Astro**, **Tailwind** and **Bun** as runtime environment for its innate **TypeScript** support. Animations with canvas elements and vector graphics. Application of a reactive BÃ©zier curve inspired by Oliver Larose. Continuously deployed with **Netifly**. Encryption certificate issued by **Let's Encrypt** with Netifly CLI.

## Why Bun?

Why not? My academic background and the start of my junior career was more focused on *backend* tasks (algorithms, architecture, data structure...). So I am learning by myself the *frontend* side to aim for a *fullstack* profile. But, oh heck, *frontend* ecosystem is confusing and you have the constant impression to try to mix competing standards. Layers of minification, lintification, transpilation and configuration for a near-daily-disaster. That's where Bun comes in. It is a simple, lightweight, and fast runtime environment for building applications with TypeScript support (*I enjoy type safety*). It's a zero-configuration tool that just works and that allows me to focus on the essentials: the conception and development. It is not mature, but this only a portfolio, so it is fine. Perfect type of project to test it.

You can take a look at Bun [here](https://bun.sh/) if you want to install it. Nevertheless, this project should totally works with Node.js and npm/pnpm/yarn with minimal changes.

## Why Netifly?

Why not? Nice way to learn the *serverless* approach. I am aiming for being DevOps-competent, so I need to test the different approaches. Netifly is a good way to start. It is free for our static needs, easy to use, and has a good documentation. It is also a good way to learn the *continuous deployment* approach.

But I am also an *open source* enthusiast, so I understand people who support *open source*/self-hosted solution. So I can suggest you to take a look at [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) if you want to replace Netifly.
